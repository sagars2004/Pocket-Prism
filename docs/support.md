## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is my financial data safe?**
Yes. Your data is stored locally on your device's secure storage. We do not transmit, sync, or back up your personal financial inputs to any external servers. You are the only one who has access to your data.

**Why do I need to enter my state?**
Finsh uses your state of residence to automatically estimate your state and federal tax obligations. This allows us to give you a "real feel" number for your take-home pay, rather than just gross salary.

**How do I delete my data?**
Since all your data is stored locally on your device, restarting the app, or even returning to the homepage, will automatically erase all your data.

**Does Finsh work offline?**
Absolutely. Since Finsh is a "local-first" app, it is fully functional without an internet connection. Think of it as the same caliber as a calculator or weather app that you can just pull up on your phone anytime, anywhere.

**Is Finsh free to use?**
Yes, Finsh is currently completely free to use. Our goal is to provide accessible financial clarity without barriers.

**How accurate are the tax estimates?**
We calculate estimates based on standard federal and state tax brackets to give you a realistic baseline. However, these figures are for planning purposes only and should not replace professional tax advice.
