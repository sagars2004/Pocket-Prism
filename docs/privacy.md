# Privacy Policy
*Effective Date: January 29, 2026*

**Your data belongs to you. Period.**
Finsh is built on a simple premise: financial planning should be private. We do not sell your data, we do not see your data, and we do not store your data on our servers, because we don't have any.

### Data Stored Locally
The following data resides strictly on your device:
*   **Financial Inputs:** Salary, expenses, savings goals, and tax filing status.
*   **Preferences:** Theme settings (Dark/Light mode).

> *Note: This data never leaves your phone. Deleting the app deletes this data permanently.*

### Automatic Collection
We collect minimal, anonymous logs solely for stability:
*   **Crash Reports:** Anonymous logs (stack traces, device model) sent to Sentry to help us fix bugs. Contains **no** personal financial data.

### Data We Do NOT Collect
We have strictly zero access to:
*   Your name, email, or phone number
*   Your contacts or photos
*   Your precise location
*   Your bank account credentials

### Third-Party Services
We trust the following services to keep Finsh running smoothly:
*   [Sentry](https://sentry.io/privacy/) (Error Tracking)
*   [Resend](https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy) (Transactional Emails for Feedback)
